              I work as a junior developer, since 2021, for companies within the
              Locaweb group.
              <br />
              With this I acquired a lot of experience in both front-end and
              back-end.
              <br />
              In my job I usually use it to develop the front-end HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript and jQuery. And for the back-end I use PHP.
              <br />
              But in my personal projects I usually use Next.js, which in turn
              uses React, and Tailwind CSS.
              <br />
              Also put all my projects inside Docker containers.
